Subject: [PATCH 5/7] ARM: dts: am33xx: add DT node for gpu

Add the node into the am33xx.dtsi file for the SGX GPU.

Note: The SGX is disabled by default because it is an optional module
and only some AM335x variants contain this module, such as AM3358 and
AM3357.  The status should be overwritten as "OK" at the corresponding
board.dts
